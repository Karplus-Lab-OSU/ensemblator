You can download a precompiled binary of the Ensemblator from this link!
Warning: it's about 350 Mb

This is compiled for 64 bit Linux systems. I'm not sure it will work on other systems. (a virtual machine might work though)

I'm planning to look into binaries for Mac systems.

After extensivly testing, it seems it won't be very feasible to bring this software to Windows as written. There are lots of IOErrors and Permission problems, as well as build environment issues with SciPy.
