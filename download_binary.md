You can download a precompiled binary of the Ensemblator from this link!
Warning: it's about 350 Mb

This is compiled for 64 bit Linux systems. I'm not sure it will work on other systems. (a virtual machine might work though)

I'm working on getting binaries for Windows and for Mac, but it's taking some time to get those systems set up.
