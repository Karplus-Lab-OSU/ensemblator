You can download a precompiled binary of the Ensemblator from this link!
If these work, they will work without the need to install prerequisites.

To get these to run, you will probably need to mark them as executable: (use 'chmod +x ensemblator')

After extensivly testing, it seems it won't be very feasible to bring this software to Windows as written. There are lots of IOErrors and Permission problems, as well as build environment issues with SciPy.
