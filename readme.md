# ENSEMBLATOR version 3
=========================
## Andrew E. Brereton - Oregon State University - 2016

Hello! Welcome to the Ensemblator. The purpose of this readme is to help 
you install and use the Ensemblator to best effect. The purpose of this 
program is to create ensembles from pdb files, and then to intelligently 
compare those ensembles. Many useful insights can be gained from directly 
comparing two whole ensembles; as well, there is an option to automatically
try to identify different groups within a single ensemble, and compare 
those.
	

	
### Installation:


### Requirements
#### Strict:
To use the Ensemblator source code, you will require Python 2 to be installed on your
system. Furthermore, you will need the following python packages:
* numpy
* biopython
* matplotlib

#### Optional:
* [muscle](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/)
   
   This software is needed for doing sequence alignments when building ensembles. This feature is VERY useful,
   I highly reccomend it. Make sure that it is installed, and in your path as 'muscle'.
* SciPy
   
   This python package is needed for the automatic clustering features of the Analysis portion of the Ensemblator.
   Again, these features are very useful, so it's reccommended that you install this package.
